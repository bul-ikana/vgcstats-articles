Hi everyone, my name is Matteo Agostini and I am the VGC19 Sun Series Frankfurt Regional Champion. 

I began playing Pokémon late into VGC16. My experience during VGC17 and VGC18 gave me many positive results, including seven Top Cuts in MSS events and a Top 16 at Sheffield Regional, but my most important result was surely Top 16 at the 2018 EUIC in London. My last season finished with a total score of 511 CP, but unfortunately for work reasons, I couldn't attend  the World Championships in Nashville. This year I began the season with 30 CP gained by winning a Premier Challenge and I decided to go to Frankfurt with my friends.

I decided to begin the building process from the base of the team that I used for winning the Premier Challenge: Xerneas, Kyogre, Incineroar, Amoonguss, Ludicolo and Kartana. Xerneas and Kyogre are my favourite restricted Pokémon to use in this format, since they both create great offensive pressure against any opposing Pokémon. I noticed I had trouble with the rare Xerneas Kyogre mirror matches and also against common Grass-type Pokémon, so I asked my teammates for advice. They gave me some solutions; Tsareena could take Kartana’s place, while Talonflame could replace Ludicolo. Tsareena’s Queenly Majesty is excellent for protecting Kyogre from Fake Out and other priority moves, while Tsareena helps Kyogre offensively by using Helping Hand and Feint. Tsareena was a good solution, but Talonflame was hindered too much by Tapu Lele and the nerf to Gale Wings. It was then that we thought of a combined solution to many problems: Tornadus. Between support options given by Prankster and the power of Hurricane against Grass-type Pokémon, Tornadus was an excellent replacement for Talonflame. 

## Team Analysis

![](https://www.serebii.net/sunmoon/pokemon/641.png)  
Tornadus @ Focus Sash  
- Hurricane  
- Taunt  
- Rain Dance  
- Tailwind  
I would like to begin with the MVP of this team. Tornadus was perfect because of Prankster. Tornadus’s Prankster gave me the possibility to Taunt fast Tailwind setters and Xerneas before they could set up, set my own Tailwind to support Kyogre and Xerneas, and Rain Dance to reset rain whenever I needed. Hurricane was also devastating for the Grass-type Pokémon that gave the rest of my team trouble.  

![](https://www.serebii.net/sunmoon/pokemon/716-a.png)  
Xerneas @ Power Herb  
- Dazzling Gleam  
- Geomancy  
- Protect  
- Moonblast  
Standard Xerneas, set up and then hit for big damage. My Xerneas in particular has a bit of bulk so it can survive to use Geomancy and stay on the field for longer.  

![](https://www.serebii.net/sunmoon/pokemon/382.png)  
Kyogre @ Choice Scarf  
- Water Spout  
- Thunder  
- Origin Pulse  
- Ice Beam  
Choice Scarf Kyogre is a warranty in this team, with Prankster Tailwind you are able to outspeed opponent’s boosted Xerneas and it gives the possibility to launch a full power Water Spout. Prankster Rain Dance can also change the weather from sun to rain before Kyogre attacks.

![](https://www.serebii.net/sunmoon/pokemon/763.png)  
Tsareena @ Mago Berry  
- High Jump Kick  
- Feint  
- Helping Hand  
- Trop Kick  
Tsareena was perfect to block priority moves and to help Kyogre dish out more damage. I had to consider both Trop Kick and Power Whip, but I decided to use Trop Kick because of its 100% accuracy. Trop Kick’s guaranteed Attack drop was also useful when opposing Kyogre would switch out, limiting the newly switched-in Pokemon’s offense. 

![](https://www.serebii.net/sunmoon/pokemon/727.png)  
Incineroar @ Figy Berry  
- Flare Blitz  
- Knock Off  
- Fake Out  
- U-turn  
Classic Incineroar with classic moves. I think that U-turn is fundamental in this format because it gives the possibility to switch in a more appropriate Pokemon for any situation, but Roar could also be a very good choose. My Incineroar was bulky enough to resist a +2 Moonblast from Xerneas.  

![](https://www.serebii.net/sunmoon/pokemon/591.png)  
Amoonguss @ Wiki Berry  
- Rage Powder  
- Grass Knot  
- Spore  
- Clear Smog  
Amoonguss helped me a lot against Trick Room teams, and redirecting my opponents’ attacks is useful in almost any matchup. Clear Smog was quite mandatory for stopping opposing Xerneas.  

## Tournament Overview  

#### Round 1 – Jamie Boyt (WW)  
![][Kyogre]
![][Lunala]
![][Tapu Koko]
![][Kartana]
![][Crabominable]
![][Sneasel]  

What can I say about Jamie? One of the best players in the world, and one of the best (if not the best) playing stranger teams. I approached the matchup knowing that setting up Xerneas would be key to my victory,  and with Tornadus I had the opportunity to easily setup a Geomancy and gain my first win.

#### Round 2 – Alex McEwan (WW)  
![][Lunala]
![][Xerneas]
![][Incineroar]
![][Smeargle]
![][Stakataka]
![][Ludicolo]  

Alex is another very strong UK player. His Stakataka’s Trick Room and Ludicolo’s Swift Swim in the rain gave me a bit of a problem, but Amoonguss and Tornadus helped me control the situation.

#### Round 3 – Michele Morgantini (WW)  
![][Groudon]
![][Xerneas]
![][Incineroar]
![][Tapu Koko]
![][Amoonguss]
![][Crobat]  

A very good player from Tuscany like me. I know him very well, and he knows my playstyle, so we had two intense games. In the end, Prankster Tornadus gave me the opportunity to setup a crucial Tailwind against Michele’s boosted Xerneas that gave me the victory this round.

#### Round 4 – Nemanja Sandic (WW)  
![][Kyogre]
![][Solgaleo]
![][Incineroar]
![][Tapu Koko]
![][Crobat]
![][Abomasnow]  

One of the nicest people ever met since I began playing this game. We had a lot of fun playing this set, and after removing Solgaleo the matchup was quite positive for me.

#### Round 5 – Riccardo Appamea (LWL)  
![][Kyogre]
![][Rayquaza]
![][Incineroar]
![][Tapu Lele]
![][Tsareena]
![][Pheromosa]  

One of my teammates and one of the best players in Italy and in the world. Riccardo gave me the most exciting best of three set I had during the whole Swiss tournament. I lost game one, won game two, and I was in a very good position in game three because I had the last turn of Tailwind and I broke his Pheromosa's Protect with Feint thanks to Tsareena, however my Kyogre missed an important Origin Pulse and because of that I lost. I was 4-1, my first loss of the tournament.

#### Round 6 – Eric Rios (LWW)
![][Solgaleo]
![][Ho-Oh]
![][Tapu Bulu]
![][Ludicolo]
![][Scrafty]
![][Nihilego]  

Now the situation is very important and difficult at the same time. Why? Because I'm against one of the best players in Spain and in the world, but mostly because he had a very good team that gave me many problems. I lost game one, won game two, and I was able to win game three with a couple of risky plays.

#### Round 7 – Bartosz Ekiert (WW)  
![][Groudon]
![][Xerneas]
![][Incineroar]
![][Kartana]
![][Venusaur]
![][Heatran]  

Bartosz is a solid player, but I knew that I was prepared for this kind of matchup and had a gameplan ready. Fortunately I didn't have any serious problems, so I managed to win both games and take the set.

#### Round 8 – Jonas Wiegel (LL)  
![][Kyogre]
![][NDM]
![][Incineroar]
![][Tapu Koko]
![][Ludicolo]
![][Hitmontop]  

Wiegelinho, one of the best players in Germany and in the world. Last round. If I win I'm surely in Top Cut. I could have a great chance to be in Top Cut with a loss as well because of my Resistance, but I didn’t want to take any risks. I didn't play very well game one, and in game two my Focus Sash Tornadus was burned, which changed my gameplan and I wasn't able to solve the situation. I finished my Swiss rounds with a total score of 6-2. Fortunately, that was enough.

### Top Cut

#### Top 16 – Vincent Wininger (WW)  
![][Xerneas]
![][Yveltal]
![][Incineroar]
![][Smeargle]
![][Tapu Bulu]
![][Araquanid]  

Finally in Top Cut, nowevery single game became very important. Although I had some problems in game one, during game two I faced Xerneas Smeargle with my Kyogre Tsareena and the combination of Feint + Water Spout was perfect to win this important round and to continue my dream.

#### Top 8 – Bartosz Ekiert (WW)  
![][Groudon]
![][Xerneas]
![][Incineroar]
![][Kartana]
![][Venusaur]
![][Heatran]  

I played against Brtosz during the Swiss rounds, so I knew my plan and I had the opportunity to win this round with the same strategy I used the day before.

#### Top 4 – Matthias Suchodolski (WLW)  
![][Groudon]
![][Xerneas]
![][Incineroar]
![][Kartana]
![][Venusaur]
![][Heatran]  

I'm on fire, I'm hyped, I felt that I was very close to the finals. Matthias was difficultto defeat I won game one and then I lost game two. Game three was enjoyable, butmostly because it gave me a way the access the finals.

#### Finals – Alessio Yuri Boschetto (WW)  
![][Groudon]
![][Xerneas]
![][Incineroar]
![][Kartana]
![][Venusaur]
![][Heatran]  

Here I am. I'm in the finals. One of the most legendary players in the world, Yuree stood between me and the achievement of a dream. I knew that Yuree had different items on his team compared to Matthias and Bartosz, so it was a little bit more difficult to choose a plan. During game one I didn't expect Yuree’s Groudon to use Rock Slide, but I was lucky because my Tornadus avoided it, and it immediately gave me the opportunity to control both the situation and the weather. In game two I decided to change my lead and set up immediately with my own Xerneas. Yuree’s critical hit on my Incineroar was a blessing to me because it gave me the opportunity to freely switch in my Choice Scarf Kyogre. At this point Moonblast, Dazzling Gleam, and Ice Beam closed the deal.

First place out of 239 Masters. I got it, I can't believe it, I'm the Champion of the biggest European Regional Championship ever. At the end, the dream came true. 

Special thanks to Simone Casini and Andrea Pagano, all my teammates, all my friends, my family and my girlfriend, and anyone who supported me.

Matteo Agostini
