Hi, I’m Jake Magier, jackofspadesman online, and I was born, raised, and still live in the suburbs of Boston, MA. I’ve been playing Pokémon for as long as I can remember, and I started gaining interest in competitive Pokémon after I got Pokémon Diamond in 2006. I started playing VGC thanks to my good friend, Aaron Traylor ([@TBFUnreality](https://twitter.com/TBFUnreality)). We’ve remained best friends through high school and college. He brought me under his wing in late 2014 — I suspect because he wanted a close friend with the same love of Pokémon to start playing VGC and I’m sure he also wanted rides to our local Premier Challenges.  My first regional ever was St. Louis in 2015, which (to my elation) Aaron won, so winning Collinsville this year was special to me.

After watching my good friends Brendan Zheng ([@Babbytron](https://twitter.com/Babbytron)) and Paul Chua ([@Paul_Chua_](https://twitter.com/Paul_Chua_)) get Top 16 at the most recent World Championships, and another good friend  Jeremy Odena ([@JayOhh_12](https://twitter.com/JayOhh_12)) making Day 2, I decided that, after 4 years, it was time to put my full effort into improving at the game I love and get my first invite to Worlds. There’s been a real fire in my heart this season, and I’m in a fantastic spot in my life to be fortunate enough to focus my time on competing.

## At A Glance
![][Xerneas]![][Groudon]![][Incineroar]![][Amoonguss]![][Volcarona]![][Tapu Koko]

When I first saw the team sent to the My Name Jeff Gaming (MNJG) group by Paul Chua, something about the team clicked with me. Xerneas is the best restricted in the format. With its potent offensive presence it can end any match in an instant while also acting as a red herring for the rest of the team to do its own work. By setting up sun via its Drought ability, Groudon enhances the offensive abilities of Volcarona and Incineroar while countering opposing Kyogre’s Drizzle ability. Amoonguss shuts down my opponents’ set up and momentum while enabling my own. Volcarona isn’t a common Pokémon in VGC 2019, but after seeing its damage output with the Z-Move Inferno Overdrive off of Overheat, coupled with its incredible utility moves, I was quickly convinced of this Pokémon’s place on the team. Volcarona handily counters the popular Venusaur + Groudon core by having a chance to OHKO Groudon as well as bringing Venusaur down to its usual Focus Sash. Venusaur, annoyingly, could still put Volcarona to sleep, so Tapu Koko filled the role of supporting the team with its Electric Surge ability to counter sleep. Tapu Koko also served as one of my primary answers to Kyogre and Ho-Oh. The original idea for this team came from Scar’s ([@Scar3020](https://twitter.com/Scar3020)) success with it at the 38th Ganyu Off ([@GanyuOff](https://twitter.com/GanyuOff)) in Japan, but I felt like it could use some slight adjustments to make the overall team more cohesive. So quickly, here are some important changes I made:

1. Tapu Koko very often wants to be paired with Volcarona to beat Venusaur, and since Volcarona wants its Z-Move… why make Koko’s item worthless with Electrium Z? I settled on Assault Vest so Tapu Koko can actually handle threats like Choice Scarf Kyogre — it can KO Kyogre but not survive its attacks without it. Not only that but Sludge Bomb from Venusaur would just KO Tapu Koko without the Assault Vest.
2. Tornadus + Kyogre teams weren’t a problematic matchup for me when playtesting the team, so I never felt Coba Berry was the right item, despite its popularity on other versions of this team. I didn’t bother with Payapa Berry because I felt my Lunala and Tapu Lele matchup was fine. I did, however, consider Occa Berry for sun-boosted Flare Blitz from Incineroar, but ultimately settled on Aguav Berry as Amoonguss often survived attacks in the range to activate its pinch berry. This item choice ended up being HUGE for me.
3. Whirlwind was something I liked for a while on Volcarona, but it ended up feeling useless unless a Pokémon is threatening to set up Trick Room (which usually just ends up in a fake out on Volcarona) or a set up Pokemon like Xerneas is on the field. Rage Powder was a far better utility option overall, and it helped me seal up many games.

So, with those decisions and some practice, I was loving the team and brought it back to MNJG throughout the weeks leading up to the event for refinement. On Tuesday before the event, Brendan Zheng messaged me asking how to use the team, as he wanted to use it at a Premier Challenge he had over the weekend. He questioned the team a bit, asking why I had Dazzling Gleam on Koko and what that did for me. Well, he was right - it didn’t do much. He suggested running Wild Charge to get some sweet KOs (whichit certainly did). I shared the change with the rest of MNJG and Aaron suggested swapping in Brave Bird for Nature’s Madness to catch Pokémon like Amoonguss off guard. It took some convincing from him and Zach Carlson ([@profshroomish](https://twitter.com/moodybluest)) but ultimately it was a good decision. With Tapu Koko’s Nature switched to Jolly, the team was locked in and I was ready for the regional. I flew out late Thursday morning and arrived that night to visit my wonderful girlfriend, Hillary ([@1inkfloyd](https://twitter.com/1inkfloyd)), at college and meet some of her friends. It was a great way to ease myself into the trip, spend quality time with one of my favorite people in the world, and not get cold feet before the tournament.

AaronTraylor (Xerneas) @ Power Herb   
Ability: Fairy Aura   
EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe   
Timid Nature  
IVs: 0 Atk  
- Moonblast  
- Geomancy  
- Dazzling Gleam  
- Protect  
Bring rate: 22/22, 100%  
Win rate: 16/22, 72.7% 

Initially I ran 28 HP / 4 Def / 196 SpA / 28 SpD / 252 Spe in order to tank a Kyogre Water Spout in rain, but I have Groudon! If I can’t position myself properly and have to take that Water Spout, I’m not a good enough player. Oh, and also this set of neat calcs:

* +2 252 SpA Fairy Aura Xerneas Dazzling Gleam vs. 236 HP / 236+ SpD Incineroar: 106-126 (53 - 63%)
* 0 Atk Tapu Koko Wild Charge vs. 236 HP / 4 Def Incineroar in Electric Terrain: 94-112 (47 - 56%)  

These two together guaranteed the KO which never came into play and, honestly, I forgot about, but that was why I changed.

zach carlson (Groudon) @ Figy Berry   
Ability: Drought   
EVs: 196 HP / 252 SpD / 60 Spe   
Careful Nature   
- Precipice Blades  
- Swords Dance  
- Rock Tomb  
- Protect  
Bring rate: 22/22, 100%  
Win rate: 16/22, 72.7%
 
With an HP stat divisible by four, Groudon will eat its Figy Berry after two Super Fangs/Nature’s Madness. Groudon has enough speed to outspeed Scarf Kyogre while in Tailwind, and max SpD stat for the best luck against modest Kyogre as well as surviving a Geomancy-boosted Moonblast from Timid Xerneas. In retrospect, Groudon may actually want 68 speed EVs to hit 119 Speed and outspeed Kartana and Gengar after a Rock Tomb or an Electroweb from Tapu Koko, which is something I forgot about when building this Groudon. The issue then is that you either take a stat point out of HP and ruin your divisible by four berry calculation, or you lower your Special Defense and allow the Modest Water Spout from Kyogre to have a 36.7% chance to 2HKO instead of a mere 12.9%, so pick your poison with one of these three options!

ChuppaNCross (Incineroar) (M) @ Iapapa Berry

Bring rate: 13/22, 59.1%  
Win rate: 10/13, 76.9%  
 
With an HP stat divisible by four, Incineroar will eat its Iapapa Berry after two Super Fangs/Nature’s Madness. Incineroar’s Special Defense training was to survive a Geomancy-boosted Moonblast from Timid Xerneas. I ran 28 Speed here in order to underspeed minimum speed Kyogre/Groudon and outspeed Xerneas/Volcarona in Tailwind. I think having a bit of speed to potentially Fake Out other Incineroar is important, but some may argue a slower U-Turn is more important. Level 44 because his name is Chuppa N Cross THE FOURTH!!!!

![](https://www.serebii.net/sunmoon/pokemon/591.png)  
Wacka+Joseph (Amoonguss) @ Aguav Berry  
Ability: Regenerator  
Level: 55  
EVs: 244 HP / 92 Def / 172 SpD  
Calm Nature  
IVs: 0 Atk / 22 Spe  
- Spore  
- Rage Powder  
- Grass Knot  
- Clear Smog  
Bring rate: 12/22, 54.5%  
Win rate: 11/12, 91.7%  

With an HP stat divisible by four, Amoonguss will eat its Aguav Berry after two Super Fangs/Nature’s Madness. Amoonguss’ Defense investment is used to survive 252 Adamant Groudon’s Fire Punch and 22 Speed was just a silly little thing I did which never came into play really. This minimized Gyro Ball damage while also allowing me to outspeed almost all Incineroar while in Tailwind. Shout outs to Aaron for realizing that in Sun Series! Level 55 because apparently that’s Wacka’s (@WackaPuff) favorite number. Wacka and Joseph (@c9_joseph) are good friends :)

Ian Combs (Volcarona) @ Firium Z  
Ability: Flame Body

- Overheat  
- Tailwind  
- Rage Powder  
- Protect  
Bring rate: 11/22, 50%  
Win rate: 7/11, 63.6%  
 
Named after Volcarona enthusiast and good friend, Ian ([@\__Jakuzure](https://twitter.com/__Jakuzure)). The 52 Defense was to survive Timid Tapu Lele’s Psyshock. While this calc never came up, the investment DID help in one of my Swiss matches, shockingly, so keep reading!

![](https://www.serebii.net/sunmoon/pokemon/785.png)  

Paul+Brendan (Tapu Koko) @ Assault Vest  
Ability: Electric Surge  
EVs: 188 HP / 212 SpD / 108 Spe  
Jolly Nature  
- Volt Switch  
- Wild Charge  
- Brave Bird  
- Electroweb  
Bring rate: 8/22, 36.4%  
Win rate: 4/8, 50%  
 
Info: I may have lost both Swiss sets I brought Tapu Koko, but I’ll be a Mankey’s uncle if it didn’t carry me to victory in Top 8 and Top 4 on stream! The Speed is to outspeed Tornadus, the SpD and HP survive Geomancy-boosted Moonblast from Timid Xerneas, and the HP gives me a 15/16 chance to survive Intimidated  Precipice Blades from a 252 Adamant Groudon! As mentioned, Jolly was chosen for the proper damage with Wild Charge like this: 0 Atk Tapu Koko Wild Charge vs. 4 HP / 0 Def Kyogre in Electric Terrain: 188-224 (106.8 - 127.2%) -- guaranteed OHKO.

## Day 1

#### Round 1 ­— Daniel Strelka — (WW) — 1–0
![][Kyogre]![][Xerneas]![][Tapu Bulu]![][Volcarona]![][Togekiss]![][Liepard]  
Game 1: ![][Incineroar]![][Xerneas]/![][Groudon]![][Amoonguss] vs ![][Liepard]![][Xerneas]/![][Volcarona]![][Kyogre]  
Game 2: ![][Incineroar]![][Amoonguss]/![][Xerneas]![][Groudon] vs ![][Liepard]![][Xerneas]/![][Tapu Bulu]![][Togekiss]

Liepard frightened me with its options of fast Knock Off, Fake Out, Encore, and Taunt. In Game One, I redirected a Volcarona Whirlwind with Amoonguss’ Rage Powder which felt great. Game Two I led differently and went for the quick Geomancy + Clear Smog  and got Amoonguss Taunted with a free Geomancy. I then got Amoonguss off the field for Incineroar in order to play around Encore.
 
Since we finished up very quickly, judges selected us for hack checks. The judge informed me that my 3DS was not on the right firmware version and I would be taking a Game One loss in my next round. I sulked a bit from the bad news, but decided to focus on the tournament. Pairings went up and I saw that my next match would be against an accomplished player, so I knew I’d have to play perfectly.

#### Round 2 — Fiona Szymkiewicz ([@Yoshiandlugia](https://twitter.com/Yoshiandlugia)) — (LWW) — 2–0
![][Xerneas]![][Yveltal]![][Incineroar]![][Kartana]![][Amoonguss]![][Raichu]  
Game 1: *Loss from Round One judge ruling*  
Game 2: ![][Xerneas]![][Volcarona]/![][Groudon]![][Incineroar] vs ![][Xerneas]![][Raichu]/![][Yveltal]![][Incineroar]  
Game 3: ![][Xerneas]![][Amoonguss]/![][Groudon]![][Incineroar] vs ![][Xerneas]![][Raichu]/![][Yveltal]![][Incineroar]

I remember seeing Raichu come out first and thinking how fortunate I was for not bringing Tapu Koko. I set up Xerneas properly in both games while navigating around the ever-tricky Raichu with its Nuzzles and Fake Outs to secure myself a 2-0 record which felt amazing given the penalty loss I took.

#### Round 3 — Alex Arand ([@AlexTheRNGLord](https://twitter.com/AlexTheRNGLord)) — (WLW) — 3–0  
![][Solgaleo]![][Zygarde]![][Incineroar]![][Tapu Fini]![][Venusaur]![][Toxicroak]  
Game 1: ![][Volcarona]![][Xerneas]/![][Amoonguss]![][Groudon] vs ![][Venusaur]![][Solgaleo]/![][Tapu Fini]![][Zygarde]  
Game 2: ![][Volcarona]![][Xerneas]/![][Amoonguss]![][Groudon] vs ![][Incineroar]![][Solgaleo]/![][Tapu Fini]![][Zygarde]  
Game 3: ![][Volcarona]![][Xerneas]/![][Amoonguss]![][Groudon] vs ![][Venusaur]![][Incineroar]/![][Solgaleo]![][Zygarde]  

I recognized him as AlexTheRNGLord which, sadly, couldn’t be further from the truth. Alex had a number of unlucky breaks go in my favor in our set. In Game One, he missed a Turn One Sleep Powder on my Volcarona which ultimately led to me being in a better position to win. Game Two Alex won due to incredible board positioning despite missing a Nature’s Madness AND a self-Swagger, so I have to give him kudos. And that brings us to Game Three, where he didn’t bring Tapu Fini. Without it, he couldn’t heal his Pokémon using Heal Pulse, and nothing prevented Amoonguss from putting his Pokémon to sleep, which allowed me to win this game with a pinch of sweat on my forehead. At one point, Zygarde went for an Extreme Speed onto Volcarona and it survived with ONE SINGLE HIT POINT. Eat it, Chuppa, the defense investment did help. Alex and I spoke a bit and quickly became friendly. Alex asked me to win for his resistance, and I did my best for him, but he didn’t need me as he finished 6–1. This was the only match of mine in the tournament other than Finals that went to a third game

#### Round 4 — Adam Baltrusaitis ([@DecimVGC](https://twitter.com/DecimVGC)) — (WW) — 4–0
![][Kyogre]![][Xerneas]![][Incineroar]![][Kartana]![][Amoonguss]![][Tornadus]  
Game 1: ![][Xerneas]![][Incineroar]/![][Groudon]![][Amoonguss] vs ![][Incineroar]![][Tornadus]/![][Kyogre]![][Xerneas]  
Game 2: ![][Xerneas]![][Incineroar]/![][Groudon]![][Amoonguss] vs ![][Incineroar]![][Kartana]/![][Kyogre]![][Xerneas]  

I was nervous from team preview, but I have plenty of experience against the TornOgre core and have developed a game plan. A Fake Out and Dazzling Gleam to start things off in Game One worked well and I took out Tornadus which allowed Amoonguss to do its job, sealing up that game. In Game Two, I protected Xerneas Turn One as Incineroar got hit with a Fake Out and Sacred Sword for a lot of damage. With my back against the wall, I went for Geomancy and Flare Blitz into Kartana. Luck was on my side as Incineroar, outsped by Kartana, survived with one single hit point from a second Sacred Sword which won me the game in an instant.

#### Round 5 — Whitney Johnson ([@Brokepokemon](https://twitter.com/Brokepokemon)) — (LL) — 4–1
![][Kyogre]![][Xerneas]![][Tapu Lele]![][Accelgor]![][Kartana]![][Amoonguss]  
Game 1: ![][Tapu Koko]![][Incineroar]/![][Groudon]![][Xerneas] vs ![][Accelgor]![][Tapu Lele]/![][Kartana]![][Kyogre]  
Game 2: ![][Tapu Koko]![][Incineroar]/![][Groudon]![][Xerneas] vs ![][Accelgor]![][Kyogre]/![][Kartana]![][Tapu Lele]  

I thought my Game One leads were brilliant. I clicked Fake Out on Accelgor and went for a Volt Switch to get Xerneas on the field… and that’s when Whitney reminded me that Accelgor learns Encore and rendered it useless while leaving Xerneas a sitting duck. I came close to a runback, but ultimately it wasn’t possible. Game Two I thought I could lead the same way and this time Brave Bird Accelgor for a knockout, but Whitney was a step ahead and kept Tapu Lele in back to prevent Fake Out and threatened Incineroar with Kyogre. Tapu Lele switched in for Kyogre as I pulled Incineroar out for Groudon and Whitney reminded me of another move that slipped my mind under pressure: Final Gambit. Accelgor sacrificed itself for Whitney’s undefeated Swiss record taking down Tapu Koko and giving Whitney the terrain advantage he needed along with a switch back into Kyogre. I thought Kyogre was Waterium-Z, but Whitney surprised me again with the Normalium-Z Psych Up targeting my Xerneas and fully healing his Kyogre to send me to 4–1.

#### Round 6 — Corey Esmeier ([@Nvidius](https://twitter.com/Nvidius)) — (WW) — 5–1
![][Solgaleo]![][Zygarde]![][Incineroar]![][Tapu Fini]![][Venusaur]![][Toxicroak]  
Game 1: ![][Volcarona]![][Xerneas]/![][Amoonguss]![][Groudon] vs ![][Solgaleo]![][Tapu Fini]/![][Incineroar]![][Zygarde]  
Game 2: ![][Volcarona]![][Xerneas]/![][Amoonguss]![][Groudon] vs ![][Solgaleo]![][Incineroar]/![][Tapu Fini]![][Zygarde]  

* This round was streamed [here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/387014884)

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugAOgSDMA-k&index=7&list=PL9qrg1ZK7ZV3CZnlDu3auRtnUQE_6vuWI)  

My mindset upon seeing Corey’s team was to do the same thing I did to beat Alex in Round Three. The lack of Power Construct Zygarde made this set easier as Zygarde wasn’t able to stick around for as long. I was able to easily take out Solgaleo which was the only thing preventing Xerneas from hammering through his team and I felt rather comfortable playing the set.

#### Round 7 — Andrew Nowak ([@Nowakgolfvgc](https://twitter.com/Nowakgolfvgc)) — (LL) — 5–2
![][Groudon]![][Solgaleo]![][Incineroar]![][Tapu Koko]![][Venusaur]![][Togekiss]  
Game 1: ![][Tapu Koko]![][Volcarona]/![][Groudon]![][Xerneas] vs ![][Togekiss]![][Venusaur]/![][Incineroar]![][Solgaleo]  
Game 2: ![][Tapu Koko]![][Volcarona]/![][Groudon]![][Xerneas] vs ![][Groudon]![][Venusaur]/![][Togekiss]![][Incineroar]

A pair down, fine! A pair down against Drew, well, that’s gonna be messy. He tells me it’s a Tommy ([@TmanVGC](https://twitter.com/TmanVGC)) team and I knew that I was in for the ride of a lifetime. Team preview comes along and, sure enough, it was a Tommy team, but I had Volcarona to handle this whole match, right? Wrong. Turn One I get hit with the meanest Rock-type Hidden Power from Venusaur aimed straight at my Volcarona. “Maybe I’ll survive,” I pray, as “Venusaur lost some of its HP!” comes up on the screen and Volcarona faints. I knew it was over. My counter team to Venusaur + Groudon had its own counter team which cause me to exclaim to Drew “yep, that’s a Tommy team.” He tells me that it was his idea, but I come to find out that the person I trust the most when it comes to Pokémon [betrayed me.](https://i.imgur.com/arbls6g.png)

After going 5–2, I was a bit glum, but I knew I’d get at least Top 16 points and closer to a Worlds invite. I continually refreshed the roster page to see how my resistance was looking as Aaron messaged me that it was going to be between 67% and 71% based on how the remaining rounds finished. I was floored, there was a chance I would make 8th Place and be able to move onto Day Two for the first time in my VGC career. When I hear the announcement that standings are up, I rush into the event hall, leaving my belongings with Hillary, push through the crowd, and see my name in bold. I had finally done it! I cut a major event and I couldn’t be prouder of myself in this moment.

We went back home and I discussed more preparation with the MNJG crew and came up with the game plan of leading with Tapu Koko and Xerneas to force Whitney’ to make a crucial decision of what Pokémon to target with Accelgor. Hill and I woke up early that morning to return to the venue by our call time of 8 AM. Aaron called me while we were driving and gave me the best pep talk of my life. He told me that I needed to not be afraid of making what he called “big boy plays,” and I did just that when it came time. After hanging up, I put on some of my best pump up jams on the way to the venue: Illest [Expletive] Alive and  H•A•M by Jay-Z and Kanye West and I Am A God and Black Skinhead by Kanye. As we parked, I chanted along with Kanye “God!” at the end of Black Skinhead to get into an impenetrable headspace to inflate my confidence, something I desperately needed going into my first Top Cut. While waiting for three matches to finish before Whitney and I played, I stayed in that serious mentality with Kanye echoing his intense lyrics in my head, ate a pack of pistachios per Aaron’s suggestion of having a small bite to eat (that’s all I ate on Sunday until after the tournament), and got on stage still feeling just as headstrong and confident!

## Day 2

#### Top 8 — Whitney Johnson ([@Brokepokemon](https://twitter.com/Brokepokemon)) — (WW)
![][Kyogre]![][Xerneas]![][Tapu Lele]![][Accelgor]![][Kartana]![][Amoonguss]  
Game 1: ![][Xerneas]![][Tapu Koko]/![][Groudon]![][Amoonguss] vs ![][Tapu Lele]![][Accelgor]/![][Amoonguss]![][Kyogre]

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMidtDLtooY&list=PL9qrg1ZK7ZV3CZnlDu3auRtnUQE_6vuWI)  

I view facing against Whitney’s team as fighting Mike Tyson: get through the Turn One and you can win. The strategy I carved out with the MNJG crew was what I went with, and with Aaron’s words bouncing around in my head to make “big boy” plays, I navigated this set the exact way I wanted to in both game leads. I got lucky with Amoonguss surviving Tapu Lele’s Psychic in one match. All in all, this set went in my favor and I popped off *per Whitney’s request* after the match feeling on top of the world. I had just won my first brick!

#### Top 4 — Allan Martinez ([@MandoVGC](https://twitter.com/MandoVGC)) — (WW)
![][Kyogre]![][Ho-Oh]![][Tapu Koko]![][Amoonguss]![][Tornadus]![][Weavile]

Allan had a really cool team and a Ho-Oh, which I dreaded facing. With the right positioning, Ho-Oh can absolutely demolish my team by walling out most Pokémon on the team. Going into this set, I knew that Weavile did not have Feint and most of Allan’s Pokémon did not have Protect, which helped my game plan knowing I could freely Protect in front of Weavile and Fake Out to my heart’s content. From practice, and as a big fan of Ho-Oh, I had a scheme to handle the phoenix before it could do too much. In Game One I got a bit lucky/unlucky by avoiding Sacred Fire’s Burn, but also missing my 95% accurate Rock Tomb for the quick Ho-Oh knockout. I still navigated to a successful endgame with Tapu Koko handling Kyogre easily while Groudon buried Ho-Oh in the Tomb. While I thought I played Game Two well, I misplayed a bit looking back. After reading Twitch chat and seeing Angel Miranda’s (@AngelJMiranda) comment, I realized that I switched Tapu Koko out for Groudon instead of Incineroar. In my mind, I wanted to avoid taking an Icicle Crash + Origin Pulse into Tapu Koko thinking it was my win condition, but a better point is that I would have Fake Out available from Incineroar on the switch-in if that were the case. I got a bit unlucky with an Icicle Crash flinch on Koko after switching it in for Incineroar, but I was still able to clutch out the game. With this win, I realized I had just earned 160 CP from the event. Adding this to my then 248 CP, I had qualified for my first World Championships!

#### Finals — Alex Underhill ([@LexiconVGC](https://twitter.com/LexiconVGC)) — (WLW)

* This round was streamed [here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/387240298)  

I watched Alex play his two games on stream and felt like I knew enough info to have a game plan, but I never had anything formal. Also, the Tuesday before the event I played my good friend Santi ([@SupahSanti](https://twitter.com/SupahSanti)) on the ladder using the same team. I felt like Groudon was a good bring and Volcarona was uncontested. I also needed to bring Incineroar to underspeed Groudon and counter Lunala, and Xerneas is just good. Tapu Koko didn’t have a great Trick Room matchup and Amoonguss didn’t want to deal with Misty Terrain from Tapu Fini, so those were the four I decided on. In Game One, I was surprised when Incineroar survived Alex’s Intimidated Choice Band Precipice Blades because Brave 252 Attack Precipice Blades ALWAYS OHKOs my Incineroar spread. Come Game Two, I was feeling the nerves flowing through my whole body. I played the early game well by damaging Lunala with Inferno Overdrive, chipping away at the rest of Alex’s team, and setting up Xerneas out of Trick Room. So what went wrong in Game Two to cause me to lose? If you were in Twitch chat, you probably saw a few people call out my major mistake — notably Sam Pandelis ([@ZeldaVGC](https://twitter.com/ZeldaVGC)) who said I’d regret the turn forever. My Xerneas play was foolish. There was a point where I could KO Incineroar with Moonblast and go crazy, but I was too afraid of Trick Room from Lunala (which really wasn’t an issue at that point), so I went for Dazzling Gleam and missed the KO on Incineroar while also getting Flare Blitzed and burnt in the process. Hindsight is 20/20. Game Three time. I switched up my lead, and I think that’s the stupidest thing I could have possibly done. Not only did it put me on the back foot, but I played the lead terribly. Despite this, I was able to cycle my Pokémon out, hit all of my Precipice Blades, and conserve the members of my team necessary (especially Volcarona) to bring the game back into my favor and secure me the win. Alex, thank you for a phenomenal set that I’ll never forget. I have the utmost respect for you as a player and can’t wait to be thrilled when I compete against you next!

My whole body went numb, the nerves became endorphins, and I was speechless. I had just won my first Regional Championship in my first Top Cut appearance. Looking towards the crowd, I saw the smile on Hillary’s face and James Evans ([@TheKingVillager](https://twitter.com/TheKingVillager)) with his arms in the air screaming for me. I knew my family and friends were watching, my phone was going crazy from support, and I could feel everyone’s spirits congratulating me. I know I’ve done a lot of it in this report and in my interviews, but I have to thank everyone formally in writing.

## Final Thank Yous

* **Mom and Dad**: You two made me everything I am. You’ve raised me with a big heart and drive to succeed in everything I set my mind to. Thank you for supporting me in all of my endeavors, from highs to lows, with nothing but unconditional love. You guys are two of my best friends and I owe everything in life to you, love always.
* **Sami**: My sister and one of my best friends. You inspire me to always persevere and work harder with the incredible work you do. I’m thankful to have you as an extraordinary role model.
* **Hillary**: I’m grateful beyond words to have met you. Your love and support for me, your sense of humor, and your energy always keep me in a good mood, grounded and ready for anything life throws at me. Thanks for being my chauffeur, my room and board (thanks to your parents, too!), and best friend all weekend and in life. You’re the best, truly.
* **The rest of my cousins and family**: Thank you for helping raise me. You guys are the best family I could ask for and you’ve never felt like anything but extended siblings. I’m finally a Pokémon Master like I said I would be!
* **Aaron Traylor**: Thank you for bringing me into the VGC scene. Winning the same regional as my best friend four years later feels like a weirdly fated thing. Thanks for pushing me to become a better player and for being my best friend.
* **Zach Carlson**: Thank you for raising me up this season and bringing out the best in me when I compete and teambuild. You’re one of my absolute best friends and you inspire me to improve as a person and player every single day.
* **Paul Chua**: Thank you for helping get MNJG from a mere joke to something more serious and, of course, for the incredible team which I could pilot to victory for you.
* **Brendan Zheng**: Thank you for inspiring me as a player. The way you think about this game is something I still aspire to learn from you. You’re my favorite player in this game and nobody compares to you.
* **The rest of the MNJG crew**: Thank you for the prep and the support always, you guys are some of the best friends I have in the VGC community and you’ll always have a friend in me.
* **Chalkey Horenstein**: One of my biggest life supporters and mentors for improving as a person. We’ve known each other a mere four years, but you’re probably the best person I’ve ever met in my life. Thank you for always checking up on me and having heart to hearts with me when I need them.
* **Matt Bejian**: You’re the best, dude. Every time we’re together, you never fail to make me laugh my ass off and then want to kill you the next minute. Thank you for all the love and support you give to me and my family as well as all the Smash practice.
* **Moaw ([@Moawko](https://twitter.com/Moawko))**: Thanks for the amazing Bisharp of Spades commission a while back as well as for the amazing hat and shirt designs!
* **Lex ([@HappyCigarettes](https://twitter.com/HappyCigarettes))**: Thanks for the Bisharp amigurumi! He is my friend and my good luck charm. Obviously thank you, also, for being a phenomenal friend.
* **Cupid ([@BewearVGC](https://twitter.com/BewearVGC))**: This team artwork is everything I imagined, I absolutely adore your style. Thank you for always chatting with me and being a terrific friend and shoulder to lean on.
* **The whole New England VGC crew (including newcomer Karla, I didn’t forget about you)**: I wouldn’t be half the player I am without you guys. You guys are amazing friends and I couldn’t ask for my locals to be better people in general. Thanks for always giving me a challenge and forcing me to improve as a player! 
* **The Igloo**: Thank you for your never ending support, friendship, and dedication to helping me when I need you. Just for you jerks, I’m listing you all individually even if it’s a repeat. Aaron, Lex, Egg, Lennart, Maeve, Yan, Clayton “Zubat” Lusk, Wacka, Hill, Chuppa, Dani, Amanda, Moaw, Nick, Ian, Ryan, zach, and the bots we never use: Toasty, pbot, shibesbot, Thick Ike Bot, and the goods.
* **chickennuggetstupid**: Shout outs to you guys for goofing with me all the time, I wouldn’t even be friendly with so many of the people I am without you guys, so a special shout out to Trista for organizing the group at the end of 2016. I’ll also shout out a handful of you who have been awesome: Pedro, Werford, Omari, Kamaal, Nico, Angel, Zach again, Egg again, Zubat again, Aaron again, Chuppa again, Lennart again, and Ryan again.
* **Jen Badamo ([@JenBamo](https://twitter.com/Jenbamo))**: Thank you for, despite stepping away from the scene, still being the VGC mom we need and don’t deserve and an extra large thank you for staying up with me past midnight editing this!
* **The CriticalHitGG team**: It made it so much more memorable being broadcast and interviewed live on my success. Thank you!
* To any friends in my life from school or other walks of life, thank you for being a part of my life!
* And thank you to the rest of the outpouring support from the Pokémon community and everyone who read any bit of this team report, I really appreciate every bit of support from everyone :)
